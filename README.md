# Nyzul
A lightweight layout engine created for Magian Calc
## Usage
Add nyzul to your project wherever you see fit, then instantiate a `Nyzul` object.  
By default, Nyzul will locate a div with the id `pageContainer` and load it as the root element of your application 
> To override this behavior, provide your desired root id as an argument to the constructor
